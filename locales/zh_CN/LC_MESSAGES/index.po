"When generating Sphinx documents locally and browsing to a ``file://`` "
"URL, comments won't load. This is because the second batch of Javascript "
"code downloaded by Disqus matches the same protocol the browser is using "
"to visit the page you're on (in this case it's ``file://``). For security"
" reasons Javascript doesn't load from ``file://``, only ``http://`` or "
"``https://``."

"A simple workaround when you're writing docs locally (this isn't an issue"

"`Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_) is to view your HTML files "
"through a simple web server. You can fire one up easily running these "
"commands (tested on OS X) after building your HTML files:"
